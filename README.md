 A Two Player Dice Game, 
 ## How it Works? 
 ### When the player rolls the dice by clicking the button "ROLL DICE" 
    -> It Genrates a random number between 1 to 6. 
    -> The genrated number gets stored in the current score value and gets added when each time the dice is rolled.
    -> If the dice rolls to 1 the player gets switched. 
 ### Player can hold the current score by clicking the button "HOLD" 
    ->The current score value is storre in the total score. 
    -> When the total score gets to "100" the players wins the game.
    else -> game continues and the player is switched. 
  ### The Player came reset the game by clicking the button "NEW GAME"
    ->The game gets refreshed. 
    ->All the Scores are set back to 0 again. 
    ->The game restarts from the Player 1.
